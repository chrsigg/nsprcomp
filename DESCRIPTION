Title: Non-Negative Sparse PCA
Description: This package implements two methods for performing a
    principal component analysis (PCA) with constraints, where
    non-negativity and/or sparsity constraints are enforced on the
    principal axes (PAs).
    The function 'nsprcomp' computes one principal component (PC)
    after the other. Each PA is optimized such that the corresponding
    PC has maximum variance under the given constraints. Then the data
    matrix is deflated using one of several provided deflation
    methods, and the process is repeated with the deflated data matrix
    to compute the next PC.
    In contrast, the function 'nscumcomp' jointly computes all PCs
    such that the cumulative variance is maximal, subject to an upper
    bound on the divergence from orthonormality of the rotation
    matrix.
    Both functions have the same interface as the 'prcomp' function
    from the 'stats' package (plus some extra parameters), and both
    return the result of the analysis as an object of class
    'nsprcomp', which inherits from 'prcomp'.
